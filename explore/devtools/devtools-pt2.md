1. What was the bug?

    The bus is that the type for num1 and num2 are not numbers, therefore they were doing some weird string addition. Therefore by switching it to number it fixes the bug.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
    We fixed it by converting the variable into number type, this way they would add base on the rules of number additions.
